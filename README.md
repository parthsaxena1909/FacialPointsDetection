# FacialPointsDetection
Emotion AI: Facial Key-Points Detection 
The hands on project on Emotion AI: Facial Key-Points Detection is divided into following tasks:


Task #1: Import Libraries/datasets and perform preliminary data processing

Task #2: Perform Image Visualization

Task #3: Perform Image Augmentation

Task #4: Prepare the data for deep learning model training (Normalization/reshaping)

Task #5: Understand the theory and intuition behind Deep Neural Networks and CNNs.

Task #6: Build Deep Residual Neural Network Model

Task #7: Compile and train deep learning model

Task #8: Assess the Performance of the Trained Model
Dataset for this project is from kaggle Facial Points detection competetion
